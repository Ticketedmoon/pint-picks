# 🍺 PintPicks

**Pick your players. Track the tournament. Win the pot.**

🌐 **Live at [pintpicks.vercel.app](https://pintpicks.vercel.app/)**

PintPicks is a multi-sport tournament pool tracker where you and your friends each pick 6 players (or teams) from skill-tiered groups, then watch the leaderboard update live as the tournament unfolds. Currently supports golf (PGA Tour) and football (FIFA World Cup, Premier League, Champions League).

## How It Works

1. **Create a party** — pick a PGA Tour tournament and set a buy-in (€10/€20/€30)
2. **Invite friends** — share an invite link or send email invitations
3. **Pick 6 players** — 1 from each skill tier (A–D) + 2 wildcards
4. **Tournament starts** — picks lock, everyone's selections are revealed
5. **Watch the leaderboard** — scores auto-refresh every 5 minutes from live ESPN data
6. **Lowest score wins** — missed the cut? Your score is capped at cutline + 1 🔴

## Features

### 🎯 Smart Player Tiers
Players are grouped by the **Official World Golf Ranking** (updated live):
- **Group A** — Elite (World #1–6): Scheffler, McIlroy, etc.
- **Group B** — Contenders (#7–12)
- **Group C** — Rising Stars (#13–18)
- **Group D** — Dark Horses (#19–24)
- **Wildcards** — Any 2 players from #25–200

You pick 1 from each group + 2 wildcards. No stacking the world's best!

### 📊 Live Leaderboard
- Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes with visible countdown timer
- Missed cut players highlighted in **red** with 🔒 CUT badge, scored at cutline + 1
- Your row highlighted in green
- Hidden picks until the tournament starts (no peeking!)

### 💰 Buy-in & Payouts
- Set a buy-in: **€10**, **€20**, or **€30**
- Optional **2nd place** payout (gets buy-in × 2)
- Optional **3rd place** payout (gets buy-in back)
- Winner banner with payout breakdown when tournament completes

### 🤝 Party System
- **Invite code** — 6-character code to share anywhere
- **Invite link** — one-click join URL
- **Email invites** — sends a branded email via Resend
- Invite more people anytime, even after the party is created

### 🔒 Fair Play
- Picks lock automatically when the tournament starts (synced with ESPN)
- Player groups and wildcards are **frozen at party creation** — no ranking drift
- If any member has a player not in the confirmed field, **locking is blocked** and they're emailed to update
- Other players' picks are hidden until lock
- Stale page protection — saving picks re-checks tournament status server-side
